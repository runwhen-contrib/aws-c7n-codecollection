# AWS Cloud Custodian Tag Compliance

This CodeBundle evaluates the compliance of tags in a given AWS Account and Region

## SLI
The SLI produces a score of 0 (bad), 1(good), or a value in between. This score is generated by capturing the following: 
- Tag compliance for `${AWS_RESOURCE_PROVIDERS}`

The score of each check is added up and then divided by the total amount of checks. 


## TaskSet
Similar to the SLI, but produces a report on the specific resources and raises issues for each volume that requires attention. 


## Required Configuration

```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[]
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[]
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=[]
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text)
```


## Testing 
See the .test directory for infrastructure test code.
